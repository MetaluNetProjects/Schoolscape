# Schoolscape
## House music app for school

------
**Schoolscape** is a mobile app offering to play 
electronic music with sounds you can record yourself.  
These sounds should be recorded from various household items, 
such as your washing machine or microwave oven.

------

**Schoolscape** is written with [Pure Data](http://pure-data.info), 
and uses [Pof](https://github.com/Ant1r/ofxPof) to build the GUI.  
It's turned to a mobile app with the help of [ofxPd](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxPd), 
itself thanks to [libpd](http://libpd.cc) and [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc).
